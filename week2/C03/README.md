This page is built using SASS, HTML5 and some JavaScript.

You can compile the css again using `sass sass/:dist/`

### Some comments

On mobile and tablet, you can tap each book to reveal it's details. On Desktop, details are revealed on hover.

You can also tap the hamburger menu (top left) on mobile to bring up the drawer.

I know the way I implemented Media Queries is not the best, since it generates a lot of actual media queries after compilation. I used this approach because this is not a big project and it makes sass code clearer around grid rules.
