## C08 - Bookshelf react backend

This folder contains the backed for the bookshelf app.

## Instructions 

To be able to run the whole site you first have to make sure you have lifted the API located on the backend folder, outside of this. Instructions to lift it up are there. There is a proxy configured on this side so it will connect without any extra configuration.

To start the create-react-app server run: 

### `yanr start`

To run the tests:

### `yarn test`
